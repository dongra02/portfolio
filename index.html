        <p>I am a nonprofit and education operations professional turned junior software developer.
          Having witnessed the challenges and opportunities a strong tech foundation can present for an organization; I was driven to pursue software development.
          I would be lying if I did not admit to a selfish motive – I really enjoy it. 
          What started as a passion for CRMs and Excel evolved into Python scripts before I finally had to accept it – I wanted to code.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          An international relocation to Beirut, Lebanon provided me an opportunity to dive full-time into learning the basics, and ultimately to completing the Software Engineering Immersive course offered by General Assembly.
          In addition to starting a foundation of skills to build on, the program offered me opportunities to collaborate using a variety of industry tools.
          Today, my goal is to join an organization where I can contribute while greedily learning from those building and maintaining the technology that connects the programming to the community.
