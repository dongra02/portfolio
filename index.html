        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>As a nonprofit operations professional, I witnessed the challenges and 
          opportunities a strong tech foundation can present for an organization.
          This has driven me to pursue software development.
          <br/><br/>
          An international relocation to Beirut, Lebanon provided me an opportunity to dive full-time into learning the basics, and ultimately to completing the Software Engineering Immersive course offered by General Assembly.
          In addition to starting a foundation of skills to build on, the program offered me opportunities to collaborate using a variety of industry tools.
          <br/><br/>
          Today, my goal is to join an organization where I can contribute while
          learning from those building and maintaining the technology that connects the programming to the community.

          <h3>Don't Get Poo on Your Shoe</h3>
          <p>
            A silly take on the classic Minesweeper. This browser-based game was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            Players can choose from three difficulty levels and must click all the safe cells without clicking the randomly placed poos (mines).
            A right click allows players to safely mark suspected poos.

          <h3>React-a-thon – Plants!</h3>
          <p>
            This pair-coded project was built in 36 hours and using a React front-end and the Trefle.io open API.
            Styled quickly with Bulma and Node-sass, this app allows users to search an index of edible plants for their favorite or local plant.
            Results provide scientific info related to the plant as well as a carousel of images.

          <h3>popQuest</h3>
          <p>
            The popQuest app allows users to create and complete fun 'quests' within the city of their choosing.
            Each quest involves a series of clue or proximity-based stops for users to solve.
            The application was a remote collaboration of four developers planned and built in 9 days utilizing the MERN stack.

          <h3>Volunteer.io</h3>
          <p>
            Inspired by events following the port explosion in Beirut, the goal of the app is to allow users to sign up for, create and coordinate volunteer projects (campaigns).
            Volunteers are able to communicate via a live and persistent chat feature.
            The app was built with a React front-end served from a PostgreSQL database via a Django REST framework
