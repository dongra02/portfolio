        <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
        <p>
          A nonprofit professional turned junior software developer.
          I love animals, travelling and all things related to music or Stephen King.
          My wife and I currently live in Beirut, Lebanon with our two dogs and a fluctuating number of foster cats.
          We enjoy spending time with our neighbors and eating as much mouttabal and taouk as we can handle. 
        </p>
        <h3>How Did I Get Here?</h3>
        <p>
          An international relocation provided me the time and freedom to turn an interest in all things Excel into a full-time job learning to code.
          I began by creating Python scripts to automate some of the data clean up and reporting required by my part-time role while diving into nearly every course available from Codecademy.
          As my interest only grew, I decided to give in.
          I enrolled in and completed the Software Engineering Immersive course remotely via General Assembly’s London campus.
        </p>
        <h3>Where Am I Going?</h3>
        <p>
          My primary goal is to join an organization fighting for equality.
          Though my interests and skills have evolved, one driving force that has remained constant is my need to work for an organization whose mission and values I strongly support.
          The opportunity to contribute to such an organization while continuing to learn would be a dream come true.

              Volunteer.io provides a platform for users to locate, sign up for, create and coordinate volunteer projects (campaigns).
              Volunteers are able to communicate via a live and persistent chat feature.
              The app was built with a React front-end served from a PostgreSQL database via a Django REST framework

              The popQuest app allows users to create and complete fun 'quests' within the city of their choosing.
              Each quest involves a series of clue or proximity-based stops for users to solve.
              The application was a remote collaboration of four developers planned and built in 9 days utilizing the MERN stack.

              This pair-coded project was built in 36 hours and using a React front-end and the Trefle.io open API.
              Styled quickly with Bulma and Node-sass, this app allows users to search an index of edible plants for their favorite or local plant.
              Results provide scientific info related to the plant as well as a carousel of images.

              A silly take on the classic Minesweeper. This browser-based game was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
              Players can choose from three difficulty levels and must click all the safe cells without clicking the randomly placed poos (mines).
              A right click allows players to safely mark suspected poos.
